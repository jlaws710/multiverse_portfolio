This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022 - 2023 apprenticeship at American Express.

## Overview of Apprenticeship

My time with Multiverse and American Express has been an incredible journey. I have learned alot about software engineering in a short period of time. During my time on the SRE engineering team as a junior software engineer, I have delivered value through improvements and added functionality to internal tooling applications. In addition, I have taken ownership in building new applications and adding features to existing applications.
