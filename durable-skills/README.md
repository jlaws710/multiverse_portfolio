## Competencies
### JF 1.1 - JF 1.7: Explain and implement the process of building and deploying software across the Software Development Life Cycle and Project Life Cycle and describe how their role contributes to their team and organization.

- During my time with my team, I have learned the importance of SDLC. Following this process will create cost effective and efficient software. I have used SDLC to develop and build new features and applications for AMEX. My team starts with standup meetings to assign stories. We plan, assign roles, and design software designs on our confluence page using agile. Then, we use rally to create tasks for our stories. Finally, we build our code and have it tested and reviewed to ensure code quality.
- I have also implemented SDLC while creating the [Inventory-App] (https://github.com/Federal-Bureau-of-Iteration/inventory_app_project_v2_mysql) with other members of my apprenticeship team.

### JF 2.1 - 2.8: Take a business or user problem, gather data to analyze the problem, and use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wirefram and UI framework, test the application, and use agile project management. 

- I have used agile development with other members of my apprenticeship team to plan, design, and build a responsive User Interface. An example of this can be found here in this project: [Inventory-App] (https://github.com/Federal-Bureau-of-Iteration/inventory_app_project_v2_mysql). Another example can be found here in this project: [Spring-Boot-Final-Project] (https://github.com/jlaws710/Spring-Boot-Final-Project).

### JF 3.1 - 3.8: Apply the process of server-side development, including explaining algorithms, logic and data structures, can develop and maintain databases and codebases, and explain and implement APIs.

- I have implemented RESTful API, algorithms, and databases using Spring as my framework, and cassandra as my database. An example of this can be found here in this project: [Project-1] (https://github.com/jlaws710/Project-1) and [Project-2] (https://github.com/jlaws710/Project-2).

### JF 4.1 - 4.8: Manage and deploy applications and programs, conduct testing, and adhere to industry security standards.

- I have built applications adhering to industry security standards and ensuring protection of personal data. An example can be found here in this project: [Project-1] (https://github.com/jlaws710/Project-1) and [Project-2] (https://github.com/jlaws710/Project-2).

### JF 5.1 - 5.6 Apply structured problem solving techniques and logical thinking to solve problems and use creativity and resourcefulness to create solutions to obstaces.
